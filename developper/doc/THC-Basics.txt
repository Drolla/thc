Title: THC - Basics


Topic: Main control loop

Once THC completed the setup phase it enters forever into the main control loop.
In an interval defined by *thc::HeartBeatMS* the following sequence is executed:
* The device states and device events are updated
* The jobs scheduled for the current time are executed


Topic: Device states and events

Each heartbeat interval the device states and device events are updated. The 
device state is available for custom scripts and tasks via the *thc::State* 
array variable:
   > thc::State(<DeviceName>)
Example:
   > puts $thc::State(Siren,state)
   > -> 0
   > puts $thc::State(MotionLiving,battery)
   > -> 80

The *thc::Event* array variable that is also updated every heartbeat will 
contain during a single heartbeat interval the state value of a device if the 
state is switched to a new valid value (non ""). Transitions from and to non 
valid values ("") are filtered: A transition from an initial state value to an 
invalid value ("") and back to the initial value will not generate an event. 
However a transition from a first value to an invalid value, and then to a last 
value that is different from the first value, will generate an event.

	>                 |Event=1         |Event=0 |Event=1 |Event=0
Example:
   > thc::DefineJob -tag Surv -description "Surveillance" {
   >    if {$thc::Event(MySensor)==1} {
   >       thc::Set {Sirene,state LightLiving,state} 1 }
	> }

Finally, for devices that have been declared with the *-sticky* option 
(see <thc::DefineDevice>) the first occurring device state that is valid and 
non-zero is also stored in the array variable *thc::StickyState*. The sticky 
state variable can be cleared with the command <thc::ResetStickyStates>, which needs 
to be called by a custom job.

The sticky state variable allows capturing over a certain period the 
occurrence of an event, to log the event then by a longer interval job. Logging 
functions like <thc::Rrd::Log> log typically the sticky state values instead of 
the instantaneous state, for devices that have a sticky state. Example:

	> thc::DefineJob -tag RrdLog -time +1m -repeat 1m -description "RRD log" {
	>    thc::Rrd::Log
	>    thc::ResetStickyStates }
