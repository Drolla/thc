Configure the SMTP settings inside /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf
  > sudo nano /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf
Check with the command 'mail' that the mail settings are correct
  > mail <MailDestinationAddress> ...

Install THC:
Download a fresh THC package copy from GitHub, unzip and copy it into /opt/thc 
and make the main THC program file executable :
  > wget -q -O thc-master.zip https://github.com/Drolla/thc/archive/master.zip
  > sudo unzip -d /opt thc-master.zip
  > sudo mv /opt/thc-master /opt/thc
  > sudo chmod 775 /opt/thc/bin/thc.tcl

Edit the configuration file _config.tcl_ in the THC home directory. See <Configuring THC>.
  > nano /opt/thc/config.tcl

Create the log directory if necessary (default log directory is /var/thc).
  > sudo mkdir /var/thc

Setup THC as a service:
 Copy the THC service start/stop script from the Razberry target into /etc/init.d, 
make it executable, and register it:
  > cd /etc/init.d
  > sudo cp /opt/thc/targets/Raspberry/thc.sh .
  > sudo chmod 775 ./thc.sh
  > sudo update-rc.d thc.sh defaults 98 02


Topic: zWay/Razberry installation

To download the latest Z-Way version for your RaZberry, execute the following 
line:
  > wget -q -O - razberry.z-wave.me/install | sudo bash 
Avoid using z-Way version 1.7; performance issues have been observed with 
this version. THC has been successfully tested with z-Way v1.5.0, 1.5.1, 2.0.1,
2.1.1, 2.2.0.
